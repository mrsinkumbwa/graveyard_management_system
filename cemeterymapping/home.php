&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looc is from the Filipino/Onhan word look, meaning "bay", referring to the body of water the town encloses. The first settlers of Looc where Onhan-speaking tribes from Panay Island which came around 1730. The settlement was originally a barrio of the pueblo (town) of Cabolutan (located in present-day San Agustin) until 1790, when the town's population was wiped-out by a smallpox epidemic and the town was abolished. The abolition transferred Looc under the administration of pueblo de Banton in Banton Island.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early 1800s, the settlement continued to progress and increase its population. Thus, in 1844, Spanish colonial authorities converted Looc into a full-pledged pueblo. Back then, Looc was still part of Capiz province, until 19 March 1853, when Romblon was officially declared a district separate from Capiz, and finally a full-pledged province in 1868. Looc was one of the first four municipalities of the newly created province of Romblon, the other three being Romblon (capitol), Banton, and Sibuyan (Cajidiocan). It then comprised the territories of what is now the municipalities of Alcantara and Santa Fe, and Carabao Island. Looc would lose these territories during the American colonial period beginning in 1901.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 8 June 1940, the municipality was abolished by virtue of Commonwealth Act No. 581, also known as the "Festin Bill" (authored by Congressman Leonardo Festin). Looc was then consolidated into the special municipality of Tablas together with all other municipalities in the island and demoted to a barrio with a representative in the town's capitol in Odiongan. During the Japanese Occupation of the Philippines, the town became one of several emergency municipalities sponsored by the guerilla movement in the province. On 1 October 1946, Commonwealth Act No. 581 was repealed by Republic Act No. 38 (authored by Congressman Modesto Formilleza), thus abolishing the special municipality of Tablas and restoring Looc to its municipal status.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 21 March 1961, the municipality of Alcantara was created from the eastern barangays of Looc, reducing the municipality to its present size. Looc is a nice place to live.</p>
